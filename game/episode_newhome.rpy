    # show bg station

    "I had just arrived at Zoo Heights."
    "It was nothing like the small town I had come from."
    "Mice roamed the station as elephants towered in and out."
    "I was waiting for a freind of mine who I'd be staying with."

    unknown "There you are Kit."

    # show kitw talk at right

    kitw "Hey, Crash!"

    # show crashm talk

    crashm "So what do you think?"
    kitw "Busy."

    crashm "Bedrooms are upstairs, and you'll find a bathroom on either floor."
    kitw "Thanks. Went before I got off. All the sleeper compartments had restrooms."
    crashm "More time for us."
    kitw "Yup!"

    # show bg crashm guestroom
    
    "I went upstairs. Unpacked. Got out a few goodies for the night."
    "I was't sure how long I was staying."

    crashm "You can the rent this room out if you'd like."

    "My ears perked at the sound of the sudden offer."

    kitw "Really?"
    crashm "Of course."

    "It was tempting. I had no where else live. I figured I'd stay in a hotel."
    "Crash and I go back a pretty long ways away. I knew he'd understand if I declined ..."
    "... least I hoped ..."
    "... yet I didn't want to decline. Living with a freind is far better then any ol' hotel."

    kitw "So what's the price?"

    # show bg crashm livingroom

    crashm "You told about this for a long time, but you never told me why you came to Zoo Heights."
    "It was at this moment that I wish I had to use the restroom."
    crashm "Kit?"
    kitw "I wanted to get away from my family."
    crashm "How come?"
    kitw "They're rich, powerful snobs,"
    kitw "and here I am being forced to live up to their high standards."
    crashm "And?"
    kitw "I didn't want to. I felt like I was living a lie. So I left."

    "I can't remember the last time I was hugged."
