What's New, Furry Blue? is re-imagining of my old Furry Blue DJ comics in visual novel form by reusing my old Flash assets from that era. It focuses more on the slice of life elements with the DJ career serving as a subplot.

This game reuses and modifies old assets from my Flash-based artwork I made dating to 2005 through 2007. In the long run, this is going to be limited to sprites while backgrounds are done in Krita.
