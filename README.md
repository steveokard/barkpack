What's New, Furry Blue? is a re-imagining of The Furry Blue DJ, a comedy web comic, and it's spin-off Z's Shorty Manga, a slice-of comic web comics. It has a much more serious theme too then it's predecessors. 

The visual novel isn't intended as a a sequel, prequel, or midqual, but instead focuses on a new timeline while including *most* of the characters from both, and wrapping up any loose threads and beginning new ones.
